# TEAMIOS
The DotsAndBoxes project is our functional application which will be used for the beta release demo. It is an xcode project using Swift as its programming language.

The "Practice Projects" folder contains several xcode projects that we created to test different components before adding them to the main DotsAndBoxes app. The "Unused Code" folder contains Swift code that does not belong to any xcode project. None of the files in these folders are necessary to run the main project.
